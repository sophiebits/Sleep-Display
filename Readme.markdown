# Sleep Display

Sleep display is a simple application for Mac OS to put the connected monitors to sleep. After the monitors are switched off, the application quits itself.

## Why?!

I was looking for a simple method to lock my MacBook Air without disconnecting network services and without the usage of a mouse (or trackpack). On MacBookPros or connected external keyboards I can use `CTRL+Shift+Eject` to turn the monitors of. The MacBook Air does not have an eject key, so there is no way to use it.

Now, whenever I leave my Mac, while it is alone in an environment I don't really trust, I can use Spotlight (or Alfred, or Quicksilver or â€¦) to start Sleep Display. It turns the monitor off, and once I return I have to enter my password. 

## Future

At some point I need to design a nice icon, right now I don't have the motivation and creativity to try this hard task at all. If someone wants to contribute a nice one, I'm open to donations.
